### Activity 11: Zodiac Sign Checker
**File:** ` activity11/main.py ` 
This program asks the user for their birth day and month and informs them of their corresponding zodiac sign.

### Activity 12: Login System
**File:** `activity12/main.py`  
This program simulates a login system. It asks for a username and password and checks if they match a pre-registered user, displaying appropriate messages.

### Activity 13: Countdown
**File:** `activity13/main.py`  
This program uses a while loop to display a countdown from 10 to 1, followed by "Happy New Year!".

### Activity 14: Countdown with For Loop
